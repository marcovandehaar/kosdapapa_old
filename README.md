# kosdapapa
Kosdapapa is a test project in which I have ChatGPT create a piggy bank site for my daughters in which they can check whether they can buy someting

I tried to get as many coding done by ChatGPT as possible. So just by trying to tell it what I wanted, what results I got, how I wanted it to look. Eventually, I needed quite some manual fixing...

I started some new threads to see whether it would significantly change (read: improve) my responses :)
